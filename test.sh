# test.sh: build and test everything this repository holds, on the machine it runs on.
#
#   ./test.sh                                   from the repository root, or from anywhere
#
# THERE IS NO CI SERVICE. Like connect and the core SDK, this repository is built and tested on the
# maintainers' own hardware (urnetwork/connect e8611390: "We build and test on our own hardware and
# do not use GitHub Actions"), so this script is where every check beyond a plain `go test ./...`
# runs, in this order:
#
#   1. the siblings beside the repository at the commits scripts/siblings.txt pins (a missing one is
#      cloned; a pin fetched from a fork, a commit of a pull request, is named in the verdict), the pin
#      script's own controls, and the checkout's line endings;
#   2. the module census's own controls and its rows against the tree, and the toolchain check's
#      own controls;
#   3. formatting: gofmt over every tracked Go file that is source (fixtures under testdata are not;
#      the loopback harness, which a build overlay compiles from under one, is);
#   4. every module scripts/module-census.sh has a row for, by its wiring:
#        go          go mod verify, go mod tidy -diff, build, vet, every main package has a test,
#                    go test with the race detector (the root module with the core SDK and
#                    connect required beside it: the record gate and the frame code-point names);
#        wiregolden  the corpus's pinned base lines against connect from before the removal, byte
#                    for byte, and each emission decoded into the other build's types;
#        composed    the native library: the core SDK's cgo package main composed under sdk/cgo, the
#                    .def regenerated and unchanged, the library built by sdk/cgo/build.sh (c-shared,
#                    the core's release flags), the toolchain it records, its exports against the
#                    .def both ways, the composed module's tests;
#        command     as go, and the binaries the build wrote record the pinned toolchain (the live
#                    probes, which are staged on real hosts);
#        loopback    the loopback library, built with its harness, on every host; on Windows also its
#                    C consumer (sdk/cgo/ctest/run.sh), which is a Windows program;
#      and the platform builds of the root module (darwin, windows, js/wasm) and the SDK;
#   5. protocol/message.pb.go regenerated with the pinned protoc 35.1 and protoc-gen-go v1.36.11;
#   6. the codec's fuzz targets, 60 s each (a done-when of spec A section 13);
#   7. the census over what ran: every row's receipts that this host owes.
#
# THE WHOLE RUN IS UNDER THE PINNED TOOLCHAIN, whatever go command the host has. The cryptographic
# code is reviewed under one compiler, the `toolchain` line of go.mod (mls/pins_test.go holds every
# test binary to it), and that line is a minimum: a newer go command builds with itself and says
# nothing. So this script reads the pin (scripts/toolchain.sh), exports GOTOOLCHAIN for every go
# command it starts and every one those start, stops with the fix named when the pin cannot be had,
# and asks what it built which toolchain built it: the live probes' binaries, the native library and
# the loopback library. The check's own controls run in step 2.
#
# Every step runs and is reported; the exit status is 0 only if none failed. A step this host cannot
# run is SKIPPED or named as narrower, with its reason, and a module that therefore lacks a receipt
# this host owes fails the census. The full run is two runs: linux with gcc (the race detector, nm,
# the pinned protoc fetched by digest), and Windows from a clone made with core.autocrlf=true (the
# line-ending gates against the checkout they are written for, which step 1 asserts, the Windows
# library, and the loopback library's C consumer).
#
# Environment:
#   MESSAGE_TEST_UNPINNED  comma list of siblings accepted at whatever commit they are checked out at

#   MESSAGE_TEST_FUZZTIME  per fuzz target (default 60s); any other value is named in the verdict
#   MESSAGE_TEST_FUZZ_WORKERS  the fuzzing engine's worker count (-parallel; default one per CPU).
#                          Each worker is a process of its own: a 24-core Windows host whose page
#                          file could not grow ran out of commit memory in a fuzz leg
#   MESSAGE_TEST_TIMEOUT   per go test invocation (default 3h)
